    robot_n "If you kept on decreasing the ghg output even at 0.35% each year"

    robot_n "But before we move on, do you know why with only 0.35% decrease"
    robot_n "You can save the earth?"
    #Option1: "With the decrease of one ghg gas it created a chain reaction making that would end up having a big impact"
        #h
        robot_n "Thats absolutely correct"
    #Option2: "Because when the ghg gas is decreasing the other gases will start to decrease as well"
        #n
        robot_n "Yeah? thanks captain obvious"
        robot_n "I asked you why did it decrease the other ghg as well"
    #Option3:  "I don't know, I'm just a human"
